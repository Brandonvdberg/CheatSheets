### Terminology
---

- **FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name):** Complete domain name for a host. Two parts, host name and domain name. For `www.example.com`, host name is `www` and domain `example.com`.
- **Recursive Query:** Initiated by the client stub, asking for a name resolution to DNS server and if it does not know, to check other DNS servers.
- **Iterative Query:** Same as before, but client stubs must be able to follow referrals.
- **Recursive Name Server:** A recursive nameserver is one that answers queries by asking other nameservers for the answer. DNS Server receives the query, and:
  - Checks it's cache for the answer.
  - If not in cache, asks other DNS Servers (Root, Autoritative).
- **Authoritative Name Server:** Provides answers to DNS queries. It does not provides just cached answers that were obtained from another name server, it only returns answers to queries about domain names that are installed in its configÂ­uration system.
- **RR (Resource Record):** Piece of information out of DNS. Examples are A, MX, CNAME...
- **Zone:** Collection of Resource Records for the same domain name suffix.

#### DNS Names Requirements

- Maximum 255 characters total, including dots
- Maximum 127 labels, each label separated by a dot
- Each label has maximum 63 characters
- Legal characters are alphanumeric and the dash (-) symbol
- Underscore (_) cannot be used as hostname
- Case insensitive

In the case of `www.example.com` there is 3 labels: `www`, `example`, `com`.

- **ID**: A 16 bit identifier assigned by the program that generates any kind of query. This identifier is copied the corresponding reply and can be used by the requester to match up replies to outstanding queries. 
- **QR**: A one bit field that specifies whether this message is a query (0), or a response (1).
- **OPCODE**: A four bit field that specifies kind of query in this message. You should use 0, representing a standard query.
- **AA**: Authoritative Answer. This bit is only meaningful in responses, and specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question section.
- **TC**: Truncation.Specifies that this message was truncated. 
- **RD**: Recursion Desired. This bit directs the name server to pursue the query recursively. 
- **RA**: Recursion Available. This bit is set or cleared in a response, and denotes whether recursive query support is available in the name server. Recursive query support is optional. 
- **Z**: Reserved for future use. 
- **RCODE**: Response code. This 4 bit field is set as part of responses. The values have the following interpretation:
  - 0 No error condition
  - 1 Format error - The name server was unable to interpret the query.
  - 2 Server failure - The name server was unable to process this query due to a problem with the name server.
  - 3 Name Error - Meaningful only for responses from an authoritative name server, this code signifies that the domain name referenced in the query does not exist.
  - 4 Not Implemented - The name server does not support the requested kind of query.
  - 5 Refused - The name server refuses to perform the specified operation for policy reasons
- **QDCOUNT**: Unsigned 16 bit integer specifying the number of entries in the question section. 
- **ANCOUNT**: Unsigned 16 bit integer specifying the number of resource records in the answer section. You should set this field to 0, indicating you are not providing any answers.
- **NSCOUNT**: Unsigned 16 bit integer specifying the number of name server resource records in the authority records section. 
- **ARCOUNT**: Unsigned 16 bit integer specifying the number of resource records in the additional records se

- **QTYPE**: A two octet code which specifies the type of the query. 
- **QCLASS**: A two octet code that specifies the class of the query.

- **NAME**: The domain name that was queried, in the same format as the QNAME in the questions.
- **TYPE**: Two octets containing one of th type codes. This field specifies the meaning of the data in the RDATA field.

- **TTL**: The number of seconds the results can be cached.
- **RDLENGTH**: The length of the RDATA field.
- **RDATA**: The data of the response. The format is dependent on the TYPE field: 
  - If the TYPE is 0x0001 for A records, then this is the IP address (4 octets). 
  - If the type is 0x0005 for CNAMEs, then this is the name of the alias. 
  - If the type is 0x0002 for name servers, then this is the name of the server.

#### Header Examples
---
In `dig` responses, we can see the header, with the most representative fields like `id`, `status` and `flags`.
```markup
;; ->>HEADER<<-opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 40105
;; flags: qr aa, QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL:
```
#### Status Codes
---
|Code |Name |Description|
|-|-|-|
|0| NOERROR| No error|
|1| FORMERR| Format error, usually indicates client sending malformed query|
|2| SERVFAIL| Server failure, generic error message indicating error occured on server side|
|3| NXDOMAIN| Non-existent domain, indicates the domain name queried does not exist|
|5| REFUSED| Server configuration does not allow it to respond to client|

### Resource Records Format
---
|NAME  |TTL  |TYPE |RDATA|
|------|-----|-----|-----|
|Domain name to witch this RR pertains|32bit int for the time a RR should be cached|Specifies what data is in RDATA|A variable lenght string to describe the resource|



### Common Resource Records
---
#### SOA, Start of Authority
Indicates the basic properties of the domain name server and the zone that the domain is in. Each zone file can contain only one SOA record
- REFRESH: how often a secondary should contact primary for update
- RETRY: how often a secondary should try contacting primary should it fail to reach primary the previous attempt
- EXPIRE: how long a secondary can hold on to the zone data when it cannot reach primary
- MINIMUM: how long recursive name servers can cache a negative answer such as

```markup
google.es.         60      IN      SOA     ns1.google.com. dns-admin.google.com. 
                                           403574256   ;Serial
                                           900         ;Refresh
                                           900         ;Retry
                                           1800        ;Expire
                                           60          ;Minimum
```
#### A Record
Maps a host name to an IP address.
```markup
www.example.com.    3600    IN    A        93.184.216.34
```
#### AAAA Record 
```markup
www.example.com.    3600    IN    AAAA     2607:dead:beef:c607::68
```
#### PTR Record 
Pointer from an IP address to a hostname
```markup
254.63.231.199.in-addr.arpa.      3600      IN      PTR        ns1.example.com.
```
#### CNAME (Canonical Name) Record
Name that points to another CNAME or A record. If a client asks for a CNAME, will have to resolve the refered name.
```markup
www.example.com          60        IN       CNAME       something.cdn.com.
something.cdn.com.       3600      IN       A           10.11.12.13
```
#### MX (Mail Exchange) Record
Provides where to send email for the given domain. HAs an extra field, the preference of the mail servers.
```markup
example.org.      7200     IN     MX    10   mx007.postini.com.
example.org.      3600     IN     MX    20   mail1.example.org.
example.org.      3600     IN     MX    20   mail2.example.org.
```
#### NS (Name Server) Record
Points to Authoritative Name Servers for the domain.
```markup
example.com.   86400   IN   NS   ns4.example.com.
example.com.   86400   IN   NS   ns2.example.com.
example.com.   86400   IN   NS   ns3.example.com.
example.com.   86400   IN   NS   ns1.example.com.
```
#### SRV (Service) Record
Helps to locate services for a domain. For example, an SRV entry for SIP service will look like:
```markup
_sip._tcp.example.com.     300   IN   SRV   0   5   5060   voip1.example.com.
```

  - Where each field for the record name, in order, stands for:
    - Service: the name of the service, SIP in this case on `_sip`.
    - Protocol: the transport protocol of the desired service, TCP or UDP. TCP in this example `_tcp`.
    - Name: the domain name where the service is provided.
  - Where the 4 values after `SRV` are:
    - Priority: lower value means more preferred.
    - Weight: used after priority, higher value means more probable.
    - Port: the TCP or UDP port on which the service is to be found.
    - Target: the canonical hostname of the machine providing the service

#### TXT Record
Can store any text to a max of 255 chars.
```markup
example.com.    3600    IN    TXT    "v=spf1 -all"
```
#### HINFO: 
Host information about the CPU type and operating system of subject of the query.
```markup

```
